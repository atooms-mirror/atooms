** Custom trajectory formats 

It is easy to add new trajectory formats by subclassing existing trajectory classes. To make these new classes accessible also to =trj.py=, create a package called =atooms_plugins= and add your trajectory modules there. Suppose you wrote a custom trajectory class =TrajectoryABC= in =atooms_plugins/test.py= (the last path is relative to the current directory). You can now convert an existing xyz trajectory to your custom format:

#+begin_src sh
trj.py convert output.xyz output.abc
#+end_src

#+results:

Remember to add an empty =__init__.py= file at the root of =atooms_plugins=. Actually, the =atooms_plugins= package can be put anywhere in your =PYTHONPATH=.

** Custom trajectory output
We can customize the format of trajectory files using the =fields= variable. It contains a list of the particle properties to be written to the trajectory. For this simple example we use again the xyz trajectory format.

We add a =charge= property to each particle and then instruct the trajectory to write it along with the position
#+begin_src python
from atooms.system import System, Cell, Particle
system = System(particle=[Particle() for i in range(3)],
		cell=Cell([10.0, 10.0, 10.0]))

for p in system.particle:
    p.charge = -1.0

with TrajectoryXYZ('test.xyz', 'w', fields=['position', 'charge']) as th:
    th.write(system, step=0)

with open('test.xyz') as fh:
    print(fh.read())
#+end_src

#+results:
: 3
: step:0 columns:position,charge dt:1 cell:10.0,10.0,10.0 
: 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 -1.0
: 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 -1.0
: 0.000000 0.000000 0.000000 -1.0

The =fields= list can contain any particle property, even those defined dynamically at run time, such as the =charge= variable above which is not a predefined particle property!. When reading back the trajectory, the =charge= property is automatically recognized and added to the particle. 
#+begin_src python
with TrajectoryXYZ('test.xyz') as th:
  system = th[0]
  print(system.particle[0].charge)
#+end_src

#+results:
: -1.0

** Conversion between trajectory formats
Atooms provides means to convert between trajectory various formats. At a very basic level, this requires opening the original trajectory for reading and the new one for writing using the desired trajectory class. Here we convert an xyz trajectory in a format suitable for the LAMMPS package
#+begin_src python
from atooms.trajectory import TrajectoryLAMMPS
with TrajectoryXYZ('test.xyz') as th_inp,\
     TrajectoryLAMMPS('test.lammps', 'w') as th_out:
    for i, system in enumerate(th_inp):
        th_out.write(system, th_inp.steps[i])
#+end_src

#+results:

The =convert()= function wraps the conversion in a more convenient interface
#+begin_src python
from atooms.trajectory import convert
convert(TrajectoryXYZ('test.xyz'), TrajectoryLAMMPS, 'test.lammps')
#+end_src

#+results:

There are several optional parameters that allows to customize the trajectory output, see the function signature for more details.

Finally, the =trj.py= script installed by atooms allows to quickly convert trajectories on the command-line, which is actually the most frequent use case
#+begin_src sh
trj.py convert -i xyz -o lammps test.xyz test.lammps
#+end_src

#+results:

Although the script will do its best to guess the appropriate trajectory formats, it is best to provide the input and output trajectory formats via the =-i= and =-o= flags explicitly.

** Add and modify trajectory properties on the fly with callbacks

"Callbacks" are functions used to modify the properties of a trajectory on the fly. They accept a =System= instance as first positional argument, along with optional extra positional and keyword arguments, and return a modified =System=.

As an example, suppose your trajectory did not provide any information about the cell side. You can add the information dynamically to all =System= objects read from the trajectory using the following callback
#+begin_src python
from atooms.system import Cell
def fix_missing_cell(system, side):
    system.cell = Cell(side)
    return system
#+end_src

Then we add the callback to the trajectory and provide the cell side (here L=10 along each dimensions) as argument. Reading the trajectory is then done as usual.
#+begin_src python
from atooms.trajectory import TrajectoryXYZ
with TrajectoryXYZ('test.xyz') as th:
    th.add_callback(fix_missing_cell, [10., 10., 10.])
    for system in th:
        print(system.cell.side)
#+end_src

#+results:
: [10. 10. 10.]

** Extend trajectory classes

Suppose you have a trajectory that looks almost like xyz, but differs in some way. You may want to customize the xyz trajectory format, so that your code can process the trajectory without manual intervention.

For instance, your xyz file is =test.xyz= but the cell side information is stored in a separate file =test.xyz.cell=. We can proceed as before
#+begin_src python
from atooms.system import Cell

file_inp = 'test.xyz'
with open(file_inp + '.cell') as fh:
    # Assume the cell file contains a string Lx Ly Lz
    # where Lx, Ly, Lz are the sides of the orthorombic cell
    side = [float(L) for L in fh.read().split()]

with TrajectoryXYZ(file_inp) as th:
    th.add_callback(fix_missing_cell, side)
#+end_src

#+results:

As a more permanent solution, you can define your own custom trajectory by subclassing =TrajectoryXYZ=. First, parse the cell information during the initialization stage (=read_init()=).
#+begin_src python
from atooms.system import Cell
from atooms.trajectory import TrajectoryXYZ

class TrajectoryCustomXYZ(TrajectoryXYZ):

    def read_init(self):
        super().read_init()
        with open(self.filename + '.cell') as fh:
            self._side = [float(L) for L in fh.read().split()]
#+end_src

#+results:

Then modify the =read_sample()= method, which reads a given frame of the trajectory.
#+begin_src python
    def read_sample(self, frame):
        system = super().read_sample()
        system.cell = Cell(self._side)
        return system
#+end_src

#+results:

Here we have assumed that the cell side is the same for all frames. The code would have to be adjusted to the more general case of a fluctuating cell.
